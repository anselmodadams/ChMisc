"25.6.3.116","ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization","0.9375","0.9375",0,"
    Minimal ratio of the number of _default_ values to the number of _all_ values
    in a column. Setting this value causes the column to be stored using sparse
    serializations.

    If a column is sparse (contains mostly zeros), ClickHouse can encode it in
    a sparse format and automatically optimize calculations - the data does not
    require full decompression during queries. To enable this sparse
    serialization, define the `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization`
    setting to be less than 1.0. If the value is greater than or equal to 1.0,
    then the columns will be always written using the normal full serialization.

    Possible values:

    - Float between `0` and `1` to enable sparse serialization
    - `1.0` (or greater) if you do not want to use sparse serialization

    **Example**

    Notice the `s` column in the following table is an empty string for 95% of
    the rows. In `my_regular_table` we do not use sparse serialization, and in
    `my_sparse_table` we set `ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization` to
    0.95:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE my_regular_table
    (
        `id` UInt64,
        `s` String
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree
    ORDER BY id;

    INSERT INTO my_regular_table
    SELECT
        number AS id,
        number % 20 = 0 ? toString(number): '' AS s
    FROM
        numbers(10000000);


    CREATE TABLE my_sparse_table
    (
        `id` UInt64,
        `s` String
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree
    ORDER BY id
    SETTINGS ratio_of_defaults_for_sparse_serialization = 0.95;

    INSERT INTO my_sparse_table
    SELECT
        number,
        number % 20 = 0 ? toString(number): ''
    FROM
        numbers(10000000);
    ```

    Notice the `s` column in `my_sparse_table` uses less storage space on disk:

    ```sql
    SELECT table, name, data_compressed_bytes, data_uncompressed_bytes FROM system.columns
    WHERE table LIKE 'my_%_table';
    ```

    ```response
    ┌─table────────────┬─name─┬─data_compressed_bytes─┬─data_uncompressed_bytes─┐
    │ my_regular_table │ id   │              37790741 │                75488328 │

    └──────────────────┴──────┴───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
    ```

    You can verify if a column is using the sparse encoding by viewing the
    `serialization_kind` column of the `system.parts_columns` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT column, serialization_kind FROM system.parts_columns
    WHERE table LIKE 'my_sparse_table';
    ```

    You can see which parts of `s` were stored using the sparse serialization:

    ```response
    ┌─column─┬─serialization_kind─┐

    The number of rows that are read from the merged parts into memory.

    Possible values:
    - Any positive integer.

    Merge reads rows from parts in blocks of `merge_max_block_size` rows, then
    merges and writes the result into a new part. The read block is placed in RAM,
    so `merge_max_block_size` affects the size of the RAM required for the merge.
    Thus, merges can consume a large amount of RAM for tables with very wide rows
    (if the average row size is 100kb, then when merging 10 parts,
    (100kb * 10 * 8192) = ~ 8GB of RAM). By decreasing `merge_max_block_size`,
    you can reduce the amount of RAM required for a merge but slow down a merge.

"25.6.3.116","max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool","161061273600","161061273600",0,"
    The maximum total parts size (in bytes) to be merged into one part, if there
    are enough resources available. Corresponds roughly to the maximum possible
    part size created by an automatic background merge. (0 means merges will be disabled)

    Possible values:

    - Any non-negative integer.

    The merge scheduler periodically analyzes the sizes and number of parts in
    partitions, and if there are enough free resources in the pool, it starts
    background merges. Merges occur until the total size of the source parts is
    larger than `max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool`.

    Merges initiated by [OPTIMIZE FINAL](/sql-reference/statements/optimize)

    The maximum total part size (in bytes) to be merged into one part, with the
    minimum available resources in the background pool.

    Possible values:
    - Any positive integer.

    `max_bytes_to_merge_at_min_space_in_pool` defines the maximum total size of
    parts which can be merged despite the lack of available disk space (in pool).
    This is necessary to reduce the number of small parts and the chance of
    `Too many parts` errors.
    Merges book disk space by doubling the total merged parts sizes.
    Thus, with a small amount of free disk space, a situation may occur in which
    there is free space, but this space is already booked by ongoing large merges,
    so other merges are unable to start, and the number of small parts grows
    with every insert.

"25.6.3.116","old_parts_lifetime","480","480",0,"
    The time (in seconds) of storing inactive parts to protect against data loss
    during spontaneous server reboots.

    Possible values:
    - Any positive integer.

    After merging several parts into a new part, ClickHouse marks the original
    parts as inactive and deletes them only after `old_parts_lifetime` seconds.
    Inactive parts are removed if they are not used by current queries, i.e. if
    the `refcount` of the part is 1.

    `fsync` is not called for new parts, so for some time new parts exist only
    in the server's RAM (OS cache). If the server is rebooted spontaneously, new
    parts can be lost or damaged. To protect data inactive parts are not deleted
    immediately.

    During startup ClickHouse checks the integrity of the parts. If the merged
    part is damaged ClickHouse returns the inactive parts to the active list,
    and later merges them again. Then the damaged part is renamed (the `broken_`
    prefix is added) and moved to the `detached` folder. If the merged part is
    not damaged, then the original inactive parts are renamed (the `ignored_`
    prefix is added) and moved to the `detached` folder.

    The default `dirty_expire_centisecs` value (a Linux kernel setting) is 30
    seconds (the maximum time that written data is stored only in RAM), but under
    heavy loads on the disk system data can be written much later. Experimentally,
    a value of 480 seconds was chosen for `old_parts_lifetime`, during which a

    Possible values:
    - Any positive integer.

    The delay (in milliseconds) for `INSERT` is calculated by the formula:

    ```code
    max_k = parts_to_throw_insert - parts_to_delay_insert
    k = 1 + parts_count_in_partition - parts_to_delay_insert
    delay_milliseconds = pow(max_delay_to_insert * 1000, k / max_k)
    ```
    For example, if a partition has 299 active parts and parts_to_throw_insert
    = 300, parts_to_delay_insert = 150, max_delay_to_insert = 1, `INSERT` is
    delayed for `pow( 1 * 1000, (1 + 299 - 150) / (300 - 150) ) = 1000`
    milliseconds.

    Starting from version 23.1 formula has been changed to:

    ```code
    allowed_parts_over_threshold = parts_to_throw_insert - parts_to_delay_insert
    parts_over_threshold = parts_count_in_partition - parts_to_delay_insert + 1
    delay_milliseconds = max(min_delay_to_insert_ms, (max_delay_to_insert * 1000)
    * parts_over_threshold / allowed_parts_over_threshold)
    ```

    For example, if a partition has 224 active parts and parts_to_throw_insert
    = 300, parts_to_delay_insert = 150, max_delay_to_insert = 1,
    min_delay_to_insert_ms = 10, `INSERT` is delayed for `max( 10, 1 * 1000 *

    Only has an effect for ordinary MergeTree-engine tables. Does nothing for
    specialized MergeTree engine tables (e.g. CollapsingMergeTree).

    MergeTree tables are (optionally) compressed using [compression codecs](/sql-reference/statements/create/table#column_compression_codec).
    Generic compression codecs such as LZ4 and ZSTD achieve maximum compression
    rates if the data exposes patterns. Long runs of the same value typically
    compress very well.

    If this setting is enabled, ClickHouse attempts to store the data in newly
    inserted parts in a row order that minimizes the number of equal-value runs
    across the columns of the new table part.
    In other words, a small number of equal-value runs mean that individual runs
    are long and compress well.

    Finding the optimal row order is computationally infeasible (NP hard).
    Therefore, ClickHouse uses a heuristics to quickly find a row order which
    still improves compression rates over the original row order.

    <details markdown=""1"">

    <summary>Heuristics for finding a row order</summary>

    It is generally possible to shuffle the rows of a table (or table part)
    freely as SQL considers the same table (table part) in different row order
    equivalent.

    This freedom of shuffling rows is restricted when a primary key is defined
    for the table. In ClickHouse, a primary key `C1, C2, ..., CN` enforces that
    the table rows are sorted by columns `C1`, `C2`, ... `Cn` ([clustered index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index#Clustered)).
    As a result, rows can only be shuffled within ""equivalence classes"" of row,
    i.e. rows which have the same values in their primary key columns.
    The intuition is that primary keys with high-cardinality, e.g. primary keys
    involving a `DateTime64` timestamp column, lead to many small equivalence
    classes. Likewise, tables with a low-cardinality primary key, create few and
    large equivalence classes. A table with no primary key represents the extreme
    case of a single equivalence class which spans all rows.

    The fewer and the larger the equivalence classes are, the higher the degree
    of freedom when re-shuffling rows.

    The heuristics applied to find the best row order within each equivalence
    class is suggested by D. Lemire, O. Kaser in
    [Reordering columns for smaller indexes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2011.02.002)
    and based on sorting the rows within each equivalence class by ascending
    cardinality of the non-primary key columns.

    It performs three steps:
    1. Find all equivalence classes based on the row values in primary key columns.
    2. For each equivalence class, calculate (usually estimate) the cardinalities
       of the non-primary-key columns.
    3. For each equivalence class, sort the rows in order of ascending
       non-primary-key column cardinality.

    </details>

    If enabled, insert operations incur additional CPU costs to analyze and
    optimize the row order of the new data. INSERTs are expected to take 30-50%
    longer depending on the data characteristics.
    Compression rates of LZ4 or ZSTD improve on average by 20-40%.

    This setting works best for tables with no primary key or a low-cardinality
    primary key, i.e. a table with only few distinct primary key values.
    High-cardinality primary keys, e.g. involving timestamp columns of type
    `DateTime64`, are not expected to benefit from this setting.

    Enables support for descending sort order in MergeTree sorting keys. This

    allowing data to be stored in reverse chronological order to optimize query
    performance.

    With `allow_experimental_reverse_key` enabled, you can define descending sort
    orders within the `ORDER BY` clause of a MergeTree table. This enables the
    use of more efficient `ReadInOrder` optimizations instead of `ReadInReverseOrder`
    for descending queries.

    **Example**

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE example
    (
    time DateTime,

    value String
    ) ENGINE = MergeTree
    ORDER BY (time DESC, key)  -- Descending order on 'time' field
    SETTINGS allow_experimental_reverse_key = 1;

    SELECT * FROM example WHERE key = 'xxx' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```

    By using `ORDER BY time DESC` in the query, `ReadInOrder` is applied.

    option can change the behavior. With the value either `drop` or `rebuild`,
    deletes will work with projections. `drop` would delete the projection so it
    might be fast in the current query as projection gets deleted but slow in
    future queries as no projection attached. `rebuild` would rebuild the
    projection which might affect the performance of the current query, but
    might speedup for future queries. A good thing is that these options would
    only work in the part level, which means projections in the part that don't
    get touched would stay intact instead of triggering any action like
    drop or rebuild.

    Possible values:
    - `throw`
    - `drop`
    - `rebuild`

    Whether to allow create projection for the table with non-classic MergeTree,
    that is not (Replicated, Shared) MergeTree. Ignore option is purely for
    compatibility which might result in incorrect answer. Otherwise, if allowed,
    what is the action when merge projections, either drop or rebuild. So classic
    MergeTree would ignore this setting. It also controls `OPTIMIZE DEDUPLICATE`
    as well, but has effect on all MergeTree family members. Similar to the
    option `lightweight_mutation_projection_mode`, it is also part level.

    Possible values:
    - `ignore`
    - `throw`
    - `drop`
    - `rebuild`
