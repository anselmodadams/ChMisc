"22.10.3.27","viewExplain","
Returns result of EXPLAIN query.

The function should not be called directly but can be invoked via `SELECT * FROM (EXPLAIN <query>)`.

You can use this query to process the result of EXPLAIN further using SQL (e.g., in tests).

Example:
[example:1]

"22.10.3.27","zeros_mt","
Generates a stream of zeros (a table with one column 'zero' of type 'UInt8') of specified size.

This table function is used in performance tests, where you want to spend as little time as possible to data generation while testing some other parts of queries.

In contrast to the `zeros_mt`, this table function is using single thread for data generation.

Example:
[example:1]
This query will test the speed of `randomPrintableASCII` function using single thread.

See also the `system.zeros` table.

Generates a stream of zeros (a table with one column 'zero' of type 'UInt8') of specified size.

This table function is used in performance tests, where you want to spend as little time as possible to data generation while testing some other parts of queries.

In contrast to the `zeros`, this table function is using multiple threads for data generation, according to the `max_threads` setting.

Example:
[example:1]
This query will test the speed of `randomPrintableASCII` function using multiple threads.

See also the `system.zeros` table.
