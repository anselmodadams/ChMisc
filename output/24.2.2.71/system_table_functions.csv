                Returns result of EXPLAIN query.
                The function should not be called directly but can be invoked via `SELECT * FROM (EXPLAIN <query>)`.
                You can use this query to process the result of EXPLAIN further using SQL (e.g., in tests).
                Example:
                [example:1]

"24.2.2.71","format","
Extracts table structure from data and parses it according to specified input format.
Syntax: `format(format_name, data)`.
Parameters:
    - `format_name` - the format of the data.
    - `data ` - String literal or constant expression that returns a string containing data in specified format.
Returned value: A table with data parsed from `data` argument according specified format and extracted schema.

"24.2.2.71","zeros_mt","
                Generates a stream of zeros (a table with one column 'zero' of type 'UInt8') of specified size.
                This table function is used in performance tests, where you want to spend as little time as possible to data generation while testing some other parts of queries.
                In contrast to the `zeros_mt`, this table function is using single thread for data generation.
                Example:
                [example:1]
                This query will test the speed of `randomPrintableASCII` function using single thread.
