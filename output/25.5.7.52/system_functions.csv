resulting string, and interprets them as [UInt64](../../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md) in big-endian byte order. The function is
relatively slow (5 million short strings per second per processor core).

Decodes a Hilbert curve index back into a tuple of unsigned integers, representing coordinates in multi-dimensional space.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple Mode: Accepts the desired tuple size as the first argument (up to 2) and the Hilbert index as the second argument. This mode decodes the index into a tuple of the specified size.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(8, 0)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 2

Expanded Mode: Takes a range mask (tuple) as the first argument and the Hilbert index as the second argument.
Each number in the mask specifies the number of bits by which the corresponding decoded argument will be right-shifted, effectively scaling down the output values.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see hilbertEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 2 numbers at most.

Hilbert code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

A single argument with a tuple specifying bit shifts will be right-shifted accordingly.
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

For a single argument passed, counts the number of different elements in the array.
For multiple arguments passed, it counts the number of different **tuples** made of elements at matching positions across multiple arrays.

For example `SELECT arrayUniq([1,2], [3,4], [5,6])` will form the following tuples:
* Position 1: (1,3,5)
* Position 2: (2,4,6)

It will then count the number of unique tuples. In this case `2`.

"25.5.7.52","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.

Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]

Returns the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., length (arr)]`

This function is normally used with the [`ARRAY JOIN`](/sql-reference/statements/select/array-join) clause. It allows counting something just
once for each array after applying `ARRAY JOIN`.
This function can also be used in higher-order functions. For example, you can use it to get array indexes for elements that match a condition.

Calculates the length of the string or array.

For String or FixedString argument: calculates the number of bytes in string.
[example:string1]

For Array argument: calculates the number of elements in the array.
[example:arr1]

If applied for FixedString argument, the function is a constant expression:
[example:constexpr]

Please note that the number of bytes in a string is not the same as the number of Unicode ""code points""
and it is not the same as the number of Unicode ""grapheme clusters"" (what we usually call ""characters"")
and it is not the same as the visible string width.
[example:unicode]

It is ok to have ASCII NUL bytes in strings, and they will be counted as well.

The `arrayJoin` function takes a row that contains an array and unfolds it, generating multiple rows – one for each element in the array.
This is in contrast to Regular Functions in ClickHouse which map input values to output values within the same row,
and Aggregate Functions which take a group of rows and ""compress"" or ""reduce"" them into a single summary row
(or a single value within a summary row if used with `GROUP BY`).

All the values in the columns are simply copied, except the values in the column where this function is applied;
these are replaced with the corresponding array value.

arrayJoin affects all sections of the query:

```sql

The `arrayJoin` function affects all sections of the query, including the `WHERE` section. Notice the result 2, even though the subquery returned 1 row.

```sql
SELECT sum(1) AS impressions
FROM
(
    SELECT ['Istanbul', 'Berlin', 'Bobruisk'] AS cities
)
WHERE arrayJoin(cities) IN ['Istanbul', 'Berlin'];
```
        
```

Result:

```text

┌─impressions─┐

└─────────────┘
        
```
Using multiple arrayJoin functions:

```sql

A query can use multiple `arrayJoin` functions. In this case, the transformation is performed multiple times and the rows are multiplied.

```sql
SELECT
    sum(1) AS impressions,
    arrayJoin(cities) AS city,
    arrayJoin(browsers) AS browser
FROM
(
    SELECT
        ['Istanbul', 'Berlin', 'Bobruisk'] AS cities,

Unexpected results due to optimizations:

```sql

Using multiple `arrayJoin` with the same expression may not produce the expected result due to optimizations.
For these cases, consider modifying the repeated array expression with extra operations that do not affect join result.
e.g. `arrayJoin(arraySort(arr))`, `arrayJoin(arrayConcat(arr, []))`

```sql
SELECT
    arrayJoin(dice) as first_throw,
    /* arrayJoin(dice) as second_throw */ -- is technically correct, but will annihilate result set
    arrayJoin(arrayConcat(dice, [])) as second_throw -- intentionally changed expression to force re-evaluation
FROM (
    SELECT [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as dice
);
```

Using the ARRAY JOIN syntax:

```sql

Note the [`ARRAY JOIN`](../statements/select/array-join.md) syntax in the `SELECT` query below, which provides broader possibilities.
`ARRAY JOIN` allows you to convert multiple arrays with the same number of elements at a time.

```sql
SELECT
    sum(1) AS impressions,
    city,
    browser
FROM
(
    SELECT
        ['Istanbul', 'Berlin', 'Bobruisk'] AS cities,
        ['Firefox', 'Chrome', 'Chrome'] AS browsers
)
ARRAY JOIN
    cities AS city,
    browsers AS browser
GROUP BY
    2,
    3
```
        
```

Result:

```text

┌─impressions─┬─city─────┬─browser─┐
│           1 │ Istanbul │ Firefox │
│           1 │ Berlin   │ Chrome  │
│           1 │ Bobruisk │ Chrome  │
└─────────────┴──────────┴─────────┘
        
```
Using Tuple:

```sql

You can also use [Tuple](../data-types/tuple.md):

```sql
SELECT
    sum(1) AS impressions,
    (arrayJoin(arrayZip(cities, browsers)) AS t).1 AS city,
    t.2 AS browser
FROM
(
    SELECT
        ['Istanbul', 'Berlin', 'Bobruisk'] AS cities,
        ['Firefox', 'Chrome', 'Chrome'] AS browsers
)
GROUP BY
    2,
    3
```
        
```

Result:

"25.5.7.52","hilbertEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates code for Hilbert Curve for a list of unsigned integers.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 2 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]
Produces: `31`

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 2 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in the mask configures the number of bits by which the corresponding argument will be shifted left, effectively scaling the argument within its range.
[example:range_expanded]
Produces: `4031541586602`
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

For a single argument without a tuple, the function returns the argument itself as the Hilbert index, since no dimensional mapping is needed.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

If a single argument is provided with a tuple specifying bit shifts, the function shifts the argument left by the specified number of bits.
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `512`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Hilbert code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
All overflow will be clamped to zero
