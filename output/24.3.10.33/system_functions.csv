"24.3.10.33","byteSwap",0,1,1,"","","System","
Reverses the bytes of an integer, i.e. changes its [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

**Example**

```sql
byteSwap(3351772109)

Result:

```result
┌─byteSwap(3351772109)─┐
│           3455829959 │
└──────────────────────┘
```

The above example can be worked out in the following manner:
1. Convert the base-10 integer to its equivalent hexadecimal format in big-endian format, i.e. 3351772109 -> C7 C7 FB CD (4 bytes)
2. Reverse the bytes, i.e. C7 C7 FB CD -> CD FB C7 C7
3. Convert the result back to an integer assuming big-endian, i.e. CD FB C7 C7  -> 3455829959

One use-case of this function is reversing IPv4s:

```result
┌─toIPv4(byteSwap(toUInt32(toIPv4('205.251.199.199'))))─┐

Calculates the arcsine of the argument.

Takes arbitrary numeric type, which includes floating point and integer numbers, as well as big integers and decimals and returns Float64.

For arguments in range [-1, 1] it returns the value in range of [-pi() / 2, pi() / 2].

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.

Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

:::note

**Syntax**

```sql

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).

-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

Returns an array of the same size as the original array where elements in range [1..limit] are a random
subset of the original array. Remaining (limit..n] shall contain the elements not in [1..limit] range in undefined order.

Returns an array of the same size as the original array where elements in range `[1..limit]`
are sorted in ascending order. Remaining elements `(limit..N]` shall contain elements in unspecified order.
[example:simple_int]
[example:simple_string]

To retain only the sorted elements use `arrayResize`:
[example:retain_sorted]

If the `func` function is specified, sorting order is determined by the result of the `func`
function applied to the elements of the array.
[example:lambda_simple]

If `func` accepts multiple arguments, the `arrayPartialSort` function is passed several arrays
that the arguments of `func` will correspond to.
[example:lambda_complex]

For more details see documentation of `arraySort`.

Detects outliers in series data using [Tukey Fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences).

**Syntax**

``` sql
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series);
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series, min_percentile, max_percentile, k);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values.
- `min_quantile` - The minimum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range [(IQR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range). The value must be in range [0.02,0.98]. The default is 0.25.
- `max_quantile` - The maximum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range (IQR). The value must be in range [0.02, 0.98]. The default is 0.75.
- `k` - Non-negative constant value to detect mild or stronger outliers. The default value is 1.5

At least four data points are required in `series` to detect outliers.

**Returned value**

- Returns an array of the same length as the input array where each value represents score of possible anomaly of corresponding element in the series. A non-zero score indicates a possible anomaly.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

**Examples**

Query:

``` sql
SELECT seriesOutliersDetectTukey([-3, 2, 15, 3, 5, 6, 4, 5, 12, 45, 12, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]) AS print_0;
```

Result:
