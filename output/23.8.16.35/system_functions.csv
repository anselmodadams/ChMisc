Calculates BLAKE3 hash string and returns the resulting set of bytes as FixedString.
This cryptographic hash-function is integrated into ClickHouse with BLAKE3 Rust library.
The function is rather fast and shows approximately two times faster performance compared to SHA-2, while generating hashes of the same length as SHA-256.
It returns a BLAKE3 hash as a byte array with type FixedString(32).

"23.8.16.35","extractKeyValuePairs",0,0,"","","System","Extracts key-value pairs from any string. The string does not need to be 100% structured in a key value pair format;

            It can contain noise (e.g. log files). The key-value pair format to be interpreted should be specified via function arguments.

            A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a `key_value_delimiter` and a value. Quoted keys and values are also supported. Key value pairs must be separated by pair delimiters.

            **Syntax**
            ``` sql
            extractKeyValuePairs(data, [key_value_delimiter], [pair_delimiter], [quoting_character])
            ```

            **Arguments**
            - `data` - String to extract key-value pairs from. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `key_value_delimiter` - Character to be used as delimiter between the key and the value. Defaults to `:`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `pair_delimiters` - Set of character to be used as delimiters between pairs. Defaults to `\space`, `,` and `;`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `quoting_character` - Character to be used as quoting character. Defaults to `""`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).

            **Returned values**
            - The extracted key-value pairs in a Map(String, String).

Calculates the arcsine of the argument.

Takes arbitrary numeric type, which includes floating point and integer numbers, as well as big integers and decimals and returns Float64.

For arguments in range [-1, 1] it returns the value in range of [-pi() / 2, pi() / 2].

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:

It always returns Float64, even if the argument has Float32 type:

For arguments outside of this range, it returns nan:

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.

Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These functions work significantly slower than usual `multiply`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [multiply](#multiply)
:::

**Syntax**

```sql

```

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

-   The result of multiplication with given scale.

Returns an array of the same size as the original array where elements in range [1..limit] are a random
subset of the original array. Remaining (limit..n] shall contain the elements not in [1..limit] range in undefined order.
Value of limit shall be in range [1..n]. Values outside of that range are equivalent to performing full arrayShuffle:
[example:no_limit1]
[example:no_limit2]

Note: this function will not materialize constants:

If no seed is provided a random one will be used:
[example:random_seed]

It is possible to override the seed to produce stable results:
