"23.4.3.48","extractKeyValuePairs",0,0,"","","System","Extracts key-value pairs from any string. The string does not need to be 100% structured in a key value pair format;

            It can contain noise (e.g. log files). The key-value pair format to be interpreted should be specified via function arguments.

            A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a `key_value_delimiter` and a value. Quoted keys and values are also supported. Key value pairs must be separated by pair delimiters.

            **Syntax**
            ``` sql
            extractKeyValuePairs(data, [key_value_delimiter], [pair_delimiter], [quoting_character])
            ```

            **Arguments**
            - `data` - String to extract key-value pairs from. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `key_value_delimiter` - Character to be used as delimiter between the key and the value. Defaults to `:`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `pair_delimiters` - Set of character to be used as delimiters between pairs. Defaults to `\space`, `,` and `;`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `quoting_character` - Character to be used as quoting character. Defaults to `""`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).

            **Returned values**
            - The extracted key-value pairs in a Map(String, String).

Performs division on two decimals. Result value will be of type [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These function work significantly slower than usual `divide`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [divide](#divide).

**Syntax**

```sql
divideDecimal(a, b[, result_scale])

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of division with given scale.

                -   `address` — An IPv4 or IPv6 address. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md).

                **Returned value**

                -   Associated domains (PTR records).

                Type: Type: [Array(String)](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

                **Example**

                Query:

                ``` sql
                SELECT reverseDNSQuery('192.168.0.2');
                ```

                Result:

                ``` text
                ┌─reverseDNSQuery('192.168.0.2')────────────┐
                │ ['test2.example.com','test3.example.com'] │

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:

It always returns Float64, even if the argument has Float32 type:
[example:float32]

For arguments outside of this range, it returns nan:

"
"23.4.3.48","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

"23.4.3.48","mortonDecode",0,0,"","","System","
Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Performs multiplication on two decimals. Result value will be of type [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These functions work significantly slower than usual `multiply`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [multiply](#multiply)
:::

**Syntax**

```sql
multiplyDecimal(a, b[, result_scale])
```

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of multiplication with given scale.

Type: [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).

**Example**

```text
