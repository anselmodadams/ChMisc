Calculates code for Hilbert Curve for a list of unsigned integers.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 2 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]
Produces: `31`

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 2 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in the mask configures the number of bits by which the corresponding argument will be shifted left, effectively scaling the argument within its range.
[example:range_expanded]
Produces: `4031541586602`
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

For a single argument without a tuple, the function returns the argument itself as the Hilbert index, since no dimensional mapping is needed.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

If a single argument is provided with a tuple specifying bit shifts, the function shifts the argument left by the specified number of bits.
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `512`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Hilbert code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
All overflow will be clamped to zero

"24.8.10.5","hilbertDecode",0,0,"","","System","
Decodes a Hilbert curve index back into a tuple of unsigned integers, representing coordinates in multi-dimensional space.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple Mode: Accepts the desired tuple size as the first argument (up to 2) and the Hilbert index as the second argument. This mode decodes the index into a tuple of the specified size.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(8, 0)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 2

Expanded Mode: Takes a range mask (tuple) as the first argument and the Hilbert index as the second argument.
Each number in the mask specifies the number of bits by which the corresponding decoded argument will be right-shifted, effectively scaling down the output values.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see hilbertEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 2 numbers at most.

Hilbert code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

A single argument with a tuple specifying bit shifts will be right-shifted accordingly.
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

The previous behavior can be restored using setting `function_locate_has_mysql_compatible_argument_order = false`.","location(needle, haystack[, start_pos])","- needle:Substring to be searched (String)
- haystack:String in which the search is performed (String).
- start_pos:Position (1-based) in `haystack` at which the search starts (UInt*).
","Starting position in bytes and counting from 1, if the substring was found. 0, if the substring was not found.","Example:

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:

The above example can be worked out in the following manner:
1. Convert the base-10 integer to its equivalent hexadecimal format in big-endian format, i.e. 3351772109 -> C7 C7 FB CD (4 bytes)
2. Reverse the bytes, i.e. C7 C7 FB CD -> CD FB C7 C7
3. Convert the result back to an integer assuming big-endian, i.e. CD FB C7 C7  -> 3455829959

"24.8.10.5","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

            It can contain noise (e.g. log files). The key-value pair format to be interpreted should be specified via function arguments.

            A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a `key_value_delimiter` and a value. Quoted keys and values are also supported. Key value pairs must be separated by pair delimiters.

            **Syntax**
            ``` sql
            extractKeyValuePairs(data, [key_value_delimiter], [pair_delimiter], [quoting_character])
            ```

            **Arguments**
            - `data` - String to extract key-value pairs from. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `key_value_delimiter` - Character to be used as delimiter between the key and the value. Defaults to `:`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `pair_delimiters` - Set of character to be used as delimiters between pairs. Defaults to `\space`, `,` and `;`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `quoting_character` - Character to be used as quoting character. Defaults to `""`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).

            **Returned values**
            - The extracted key-value pairs in a Map(String, String).

"24.8.10.5","seriesOutliersDetectTukey",0,0,"","","System","
Detects outliers in series data using [Tukey Fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences).

**Syntax**

``` sql
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series);
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series, min_percentile, max_percentile, k);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values.
- `min_quantile` - The minimum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range [(IQR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range). The value must be in range [0.02,0.98]. The default is 0.25.
- `max_quantile` - The maximum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range (IQR). The value must be in range [0.02, 0.98]. The default is 0.75.
- `k` - Non-negative constant value to detect mild or stronger outliers. The default value is 1.5

At least four data points are required in `series` to detect outliers.

**Returned value**

- Returns an array of the same length as the input array where each value represents score of possible anomaly of corresponding element in the series. A non-zero score indicates a possible anomaly.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

**Examples**

Query:

``` sql
SELECT seriesOutliersDetectTukey([-3, 2, 15, 3, 5, 6, 4, 5, 12, 45, 12, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]) AS print_0;
