"23.1.6.42","divideDecimal",0,0,"","","System","
Performs division on two decimals. Result value will be of type [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These function work significantly slower than usual `divide`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [divide](#divide).
:::

**Syntax**

```sql
divideDecimal(a, b[, result_scale])
```

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of division with given scale.

Type: [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).

**Example**

```text
┌─divideDecimal(toDecimal256(-12, 0), toDecimal32(2.1, 1), 10)─┐

"23.1.6.42","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Performs multiplication on two decimals. Result value will be of type [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These functions work significantly slower than usual `multiply`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [multiply](#multiply)
:::

**Syntax**

```sql
multiplyDecimal(a, b[, result_scale])
```

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of multiplication with given scale.

Type: [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
