Calculates BLAKE3 hash string and returns the resulting set of bytes as FixedString.
This cryptographic hash-function is integrated into ClickHouse with BLAKE3 Rust library.
The function is rather fast and shows approximately two times faster performance compared to SHA-2, while generating hashes of the same length as SHA-256.
It returns a BLAKE3 hash as a byte array with type FixedString(32).

Calculates the arcsine of the argument.

Takes arbitrary numeric type, which includes floating point and integer numbers, as well as big integers and decimals and returns Float64.

For arguments in range [-1, 1] it returns the value in range of [-pi() / 2, pi() / 2].

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:
[example:inverse]

It always returns Float64, even if the argument has Float32 type:
[example:float32]

For arguments outside of this range, it returns nan:

Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Calculates the length of the string or array.

For String or FixedString argument: calculates the number of bytes in string.
[example:string1]

For Array argument: calculates the number of elements in the array.
[example:arr1]

If applied for FixedString argument, the function is a constant expression:
[example:constexpr]

Please note that the number of bytes in a string is not the same as the number of Unicode ""code points""
and it is not the same as the number of Unicode ""grapheme clusters"" (what we usually call ""characters"")
and it is not the same as the visible string width.
[example:unicode]

It is ok to have ASCII NUL bytes in strings, and they will be counted as well.
