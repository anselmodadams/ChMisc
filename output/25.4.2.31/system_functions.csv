[Interprets](../..//sql-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions.md/#type_conversion_functions-reinterpretAsString) all the input
parameters as strings and calculates the MD5 hash value for each of them. Then combines hashes, takes the first 8 bytes of the hash of the
resulting string, and interprets them as [UInt64](../../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md) in big-endian byte order. The function is
relatively slow (5 million short strings per second per processor core).

The previous behavior can be restored using setting `function_locate_has_mysql_compatible_argument_order = false`.","location(needle, haystack[, start_pos])","- `needle` — Substring to be searched (String)
- `haystack` — String in which the search is performed (String).
- `start_pos` — Position (1-based) in `haystack` at which the search starts (UInt*).
","Starting position in bytes and counting from 1, if the substring was found. 0, if the substring was not found.","Example:

Calculates code for Hilbert Curve for a list of unsigned integers.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 2 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]
Produces: `31`

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 2 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in the mask configures the number of bits by which the corresponding argument will be shifted left, effectively scaling the argument within its range.
[example:range_expanded]
Produces: `4031541586602`
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

For a single argument without a tuple, the function returns the argument itself as the Hilbert index, since no dimensional mapping is needed.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

If a single argument is provided with a tuple specifying bit shifts, the function shifts the argument left by the specified number of bits.
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `512`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Hilbert code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
All overflow will be clamped to zero

Decodes a Hilbert curve index back into a tuple of unsigned integers, representing coordinates in multi-dimensional space.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple Mode: Accepts the desired tuple size as the first argument (up to 2) and the Hilbert index as the second argument. This mode decodes the index into a tuple of the specified size.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(8, 0)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 2

Expanded Mode: Takes a range mask (tuple) as the first argument and the Hilbert index as the second argument.
Each number in the mask specifies the number of bits by which the corresponding decoded argument will be right-shifted, effectively scaling down the output values.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see hilbertEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 2 numbers at most.

Hilbert code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

A single argument with a tuple specifying bit shifts will be right-shifted accordingly.
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

"25.4.2.31","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

The above example can be worked out in the following manner:
1. Convert the base-10 integer to its equivalent hexadecimal format in big-endian format, i.e. 3351772109 -> C7 C7 FB CD (4 bytes)
2. Reverse the bytes, i.e. C7 C7 FB CD -> CD FB C7 C7
3. Convert the result back to an integer assuming big-endian, i.e. CD FB C7 C7  -> 3455829959

One use-case of this function is reversing IPv4s:

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]
