"24.1.6.52","byteSwap",0,1,1,"","","System","
Reverses the bytes of an integer, i.e. changes its [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

**Example**

```sql
byteSwap(3351772109)
```

Result:

```result
┌─byteSwap(3351772109)─┐
│           3455829959 │
└──────────────────────┘
```

The above example can be worked out in the following manner:
1. Convert the base-10 integer to its equivalent hexadecimal format in big-endian format, i.e. 3351772109 -> C7 C7 FB CD (4 bytes)
2. Reverse the bytes, i.e. C7 C7 FB CD -> CD FB C7 C7
3. Convert the result back to an integer assuming big-endian, i.e. CD FB C7 C7  -> 3455829959

One use-case of this function is reversing IPv4s:

```result
┌─toIPv4(byteSwap(toUInt32(toIPv4('205.251.199.199'))))─┐

            Escape sequences supported: `\x`, `\N`, `\a`, `\b`, `\e`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v` and `\0`.
            Non standard escape sequences are returned as it is (including the backslash) unless they are one of the following:
            `\\`, `'`, `""`, `backtick`, `/`, `=` or ASCII control characters (c <= 31).

            This function will satisfy the use case where pre-escaping and post-escaping are not suitable. For instance, consider the following
            input string: `a: ""aaaa\""bbb""`. The expected output is: `a: aaaa\""bbbb`.
            - Pre-escaping: Pre-escaping it will output: `a: ""aaaa""bbb""` and `extractKeyValuePairs` will then output: `a: aaaa`
            - Post-escaping: `extractKeyValuePairs` will output `a: aaaa\` and post-escaping will keep it as it is.

            It can contain noise (e.g. log files). The key-value pair format to be interpreted should be specified via function arguments.

            A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a `key_value_delimiter` and a value. Quoted keys and values are also supported. Key value pairs must be separated by pair delimiters.

            - `data` - String to extract key-value pairs from. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `key_value_delimiter` - Character to be used as delimiter between the key and the value. Defaults to `:`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `pair_delimiters` - Set of character to be used as delimiters between pairs. Defaults to `\space`, `,` and `;`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `quoting_character` - Character to be used as quoting character. Defaults to `""`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).

Same as concatWithSeparator, the difference is that you need to ensure that concatWithSeparator(sep, expr1, expr2, expr3...) → result is injective, it will be used for optimization of GROUP BY.

The function is named “injective” if it always returns different result for different values of arguments. In other words: different arguments never yield identical result.

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

"24.1.6.52","mortonEncode",0,1,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Performs multiplication on two decimals. Result value will be of type [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These functions work significantly slower than usual `multiply`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [multiply](#multiply)
:::

**Syntax**

```sql
multiplyDecimal(a, b[, result_scale])
```

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of multiplication with given scale.

Type: [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).

Decomposes a time series using STL [(Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess)](https://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf) into a season, a trend and a residual component.

**Syntax**

``` sql
seriesDecomposeSTL(series, period);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values
- `period` - A positive number

The number of data points in `series` should be at least twice the value of `period`.

**Returned value**

- An array of four arrays where the first array include seasonal components, the second array - trend, the third array - residue component, and the fourth array - baseline(seasonal + trend) component.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

**Examples**

Query:

``` sql
SELECT seriesDecomposeSTL([10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34], 3) AS print_0;

Two uniqThetaSketch objects to do a_not_b calculation(set operation ×), the result is a new uniqThetaSketch.

A uniqThetaSketch object is to be constructed by aggregation function uniqTheta with -State.

UniqThetaSketch is a data structure storage of approximate values set.
