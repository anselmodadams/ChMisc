relatively slow (5 million short strings per second per processor core).

Performs conditional branching.

- If the condition `cond` evaluates to a non-zero value, the function returns the result of the expression `then`.
- If `cond` evaluates to zero or NULL, the result of the `else` expression is returned.

The setting [`short_circuit_function_evaluation`](/operations/settings/settings#short_circuit_function_evaluation) controls whether short-circuit evaluation is used.

If enabled, the `then` expression is evaluated only on rows where `cond` is true and the `else` expression where `cond` is false.

For example, with short-circuit evaluation, no division-by-zero exception is thrown when executing the following query:

```sql

"25.7.1.3997","hilbertDecode",0,0,"","","System","
Decodes a Hilbert curve index back into a tuple of unsigned integers, representing coordinates in multi-dimensional space.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple Mode: Accepts the desired tuple size as the first argument (up to 2) and the Hilbert index as the second argument. This mode decodes the index into a tuple of the specified size.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(8, 0)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 2

Expanded Mode: Takes a range mask (tuple) as the first argument and the Hilbert index as the second argument.
Each number in the mask specifies the number of bits by which the corresponding decoded argument will be right-shifted, effectively scaling down the output values.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see hilbertEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 2 numbers at most.

Hilbert code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

A single argument with a tuple specifying bit shifts will be right-shifted accordingly.
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

"25.7.1.3997","extractKeyValuePairs",0,0,"","","System","Extracts key-value pairs from any string. The string does not need to be 100% structured in a key value pair format;

            It can contain noise (e.g. log files). The key-value pair format to be interpreted should be specified via function arguments.

            A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a `key_value_delimiter` and a value. Quoted keys and values are also supported. Key value pairs must be separated by pair delimiters.

            **Syntax**
            ```sql
            extractKeyValuePairs(data, [key_value_delimiter], [pair_delimiter], [quoting_character])
            ```

            **Arguments**
            - `data` - String to extract key-value pairs from. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `key_value_delimiter` - Character to be used as delimiter between the key and the value. Defaults to `:`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `pair_delimiters` - Set of character to be used as delimiters between pairs. Defaults to `\space`, `,` and `;`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `quoting_character` - Character to be used as quoting character. Defaults to `""`. [String](../../sql-reference/data-types/string.md) or [FixedString](../../sql-reference/data-types/fixedstring.md).
            - `unexpected_quoting_character_strategy` - Strategy to handle quoting characters in unexpected places during `read_key` and `read_value` phase. Possible values: `invalid`, `accept` and `promote`. Invalid will discard key/value and transition back to `WAITING_KEY` state. Accept will treat it as a normal character. Promote will transition to `READ_QUOTED_{KEY/VALUE}` state and start from next character. The default value is `INVALID`

            **Returned values**
            - The extracted key-value pairs in a Map(String, String).

"25.7.1.3997","mortonEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Detects outliers in series data using [Tukey Fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences).

**Syntax**

```sql
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series);
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series, min_percentile, max_percentile, k);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values.
- `min_quantile` - The minimum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range [(IQR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range). The value must be in range [0.02,0.98]. The default is 0.25.
- `max_quantile` - The maximum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range (IQR). The value must be in range [0.02, 0.98]. The default is 0.75.
- `k` - Non-negative constant value to detect mild or stronger outliers. The default value is 1.5

At least four data points are required in `series` to detect outliers.

**Returned value**

- Returns an array of the same length as the input array where each value represents score of possible anomaly of corresponding element in the series. A non-zero score indicates a possible anomaly.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.

Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.

| 9    | Monday            | 1-53  | contains January 1              |

For mode values with a meaning of ""with 4 or more days this year,"" weeks are numbered according to ISO 8601:1988:

- If the week containing January 1 has 4 or more days in the new year, it is week 1.
- Otherwise, it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.

For mode values with a meaning of ""contains January 1"", the week contains January 1 is week 1.
It does not matter how many days in the new year the week contained, even if it contained only one day.
I.e. if the last week of December contains January 1 of the next year, it will be week 1 of the next year.

The first argument can also be specified as [`String`](../data-types/string.md) in a format supported by [`parseDateTime64BestEffort()`](type-conversion-functions.md#parsedatetime64besteffort). Support for string arguments exists only for reasons of compatibility with MySQL which is expected by certain 3rd party tools. As string argument support may in future be made dependent on new MySQL-compatibility settings and because string parsing is generally slow, it is recommended to not use it.

A precision-recall curve is created by plotting precision on the y-axis and recall on the x-axis across all thresholds.
The resulting value ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better model performance.
The PR AUC is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets, providing a clearer comparison of performance compared to ROC AUC on those cases.
For more details, please see [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#pr-auc-area-under-the-pr-curve), [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc#expandable-1) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).

- Optional. An [`Array(T)`](/sql-reference/data-types/array) of three non-negative integers for calculating a partial area under the PR curve (equivalent to a vertical band of the PR space) instead of the whole AUC. This option is useful for distributed computation of the PR AUC. The array must contain the following elements [`higher_partitions_tp`, `higher_partitions_fp`, `total_positives`].
    - `higher_partitions_tp`: The number of positive labels in the higher-scored partitions.
    - `higher_partitions_fp`: The number of negative labels in the higher-scored partitions.
    - `total_positives`: The total number of positive samples in the entire dataset.

::::note
When `arr_partial_offsets` is used, the `arr_scores` and `arr_labels` should be only a partition of the entire dataset, containing an interval of scores.
The dataset should be divided into contiguous partitions, where each partition contains the subset of the data whose scores fall within a specific range.
For example:
- One partition could contain all scores in the range [0, 0.5).
- Another partition could contain scores in the range [0.5, 1.0].

This function generalizes other `toStartOf*()` functions with `toStartOfInterval(date_or_date_with_time, INTERVAL x unit [, time_zone])` syntax.

For example,
- `toStartOfInterval(t, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)` returns the same as `toStartOfYear(t)`,
- `toStartOfInterval(t, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)` returns the same as `toStartOfMonth(t)`,
- `toStartOfInterval(t, INTERVAL 1 DAY)` returns the same as `toStartOfDay(t)`,
- `toStartOfInterval(t, INTERVAL 15 MINUTE)` returns the same as `toStartOfFifteenMinutes(t)`.

The calculation is performed relative to specific points in time:

| Interval    | Start                  |
|-------------|------------------------|
| YEAR        | year 0                 |

| MONTH       | 1900 January           |

| DAY         | 1970-01-01             |

| NANOSECOND  | 1970-01-01 00:00:00    |
(*) hour intervals are special: the calculation is always performed relative to 00:00:00 (midnight) of the current day. As a result, only
hour values between 1 and 23 are useful.

If unit `WEEK` was specified, `toStartOfInterval` assumes that weeks start on Monday. Note that this behavior is different from that of function `toStartOfWeek` in which weeks start by default on Sunday.

The second overload emulates TimescaleDB's `time_bucket()` function, respectively PostgreSQL's `date_bin()` function.

Allows writing the [`CASE`](/sql-reference/operators#conditional-expression) operator more compactly in the query.
Evaluates each condition in order. For the first condition that is true (non-zero and not `NULL`), returns the corresponding branch value.

Setting [`short_circuit_function_evaluation`](/operations/settings/settings#short_circuit_function_evaluation) controls
whether short-circuit evaluation is used. If enabled, the `then_i` expression is evaluated only on rows where
`((NOT cond_1) AND ... AND (NOT cond_{i-1}) AND cond_i)` is true.

```sql

The `arrayJoin` function takes a row that contains an array and unfolds it, generating multiple rows – one for each element in the array.
This is in contrast to Regular Functions in ClickHouse which map input values to output values within the same row,
and Aggregate Functions which take a group of rows and ""compress"" or ""reduce"" them into a single summary row
(or a single value within a summary row if used with `GROUP BY`).

All the values in the columns are simply copied, except the values in the column where this function is applied;
these are replaced with the corresponding array value.

"25.7.1.3997","hilbertEncode",0,0,"","","System","
Calculates code for Hilbert Curve for a list of unsigned integers.

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 2 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]
Produces: `31`

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 2 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in the mask configures the number of bits by which the corresponding argument will be shifted left, effectively scaling the argument within its range.
[example:range_expanded]
Produces: `4031541586602`
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

For a single argument without a tuple, the function returns the argument itself as the Hilbert index, since no dimensional mapping is needed.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

If a single argument is provided with a tuple specifying bit shifts, the function shifts the argument left by the specified number of bits.
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `512`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Hilbert code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
All overflow will be clamped to zero
