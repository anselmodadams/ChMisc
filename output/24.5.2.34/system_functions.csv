Reverses the bytes of an integer, i.e. changes its [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

**Example**

```sql
byteSwap(3351772109)

Result:

```result
┌─byteSwap(3351772109)─┐
│           3455829959 │
└──────────────────────┘
```

The above example can be worked out in the following manner:
1. Convert the base-10 integer to its equivalent hexadecimal format in big-endian format, i.e. 3351772109 -> C7 C7 FB CD (4 bytes)
2. Reverse the bytes, i.e. C7 C7 FB CD -> CD FB C7 C7
3. Convert the result back to an integer assuming big-endian, i.e. CD FB C7 C7  -> 3455829959

One use-case of this function is reversing IPv4s:

```result
┌─toIPv4(byteSwap(toUInt32(toIPv4('205.251.199.199'))))─┐

Calculates the arcsine of the argument.

Takes arbitrary numeric type, which includes floating point and integer numbers, as well as big integers and decimals and returns Float64.

For arguments in range [-1, 1] it returns the value in range of [-pi() / 2, pi() / 2].

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:
[example:inverse]

It always returns Float64, even if the argument has Float32 type:
[example:float32]

For arguments outside of this range, it returns nan:

Decodes a Morton encoding (ZCurve) into the corresponding unsigned integer tuple

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts a resulting tuple size as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
[example:simple]
Will decode into: `(1,2,3,4)`
The resulting tuple size cannot be more than 8

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and the code as a second argument.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range shrink
1 - no shrink
2 - 2x shrink
3 - 3x shrink
....
Up to 8x shrink.
[example:range_shrank]
Note: see mortonEncode() docs on why range change might be beneficial.
Still limited to 8 numbers at most.

Morton code for one argument is always the argument itself (as a tuple).
[example:identity]
Produces: `(1)`

You can shrink one argument too:
[example:identity_shrank]
Produces: `(128)`

The function accepts a column of codes as a second argument:
[example:from_table]

The range tuple must be a constant:

Result scale can be explicitly specified by `result_scale` argument (const Integer in range `[0, 76]`). If not specified, the result scale is the max scale of given arguments.

:::note
These functions work significantly slower than usual `multiply`.
In case you don't really need controlled precision and/or need fast computation, consider using [multiply](#multiply)

**Syntax**

```sql

**Arguments**

-   `a` — First value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `b` — Second value: [Decimal](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).
-   `result_scale` — Scale of result: [Int/UInt](../../sql-reference/data-types/int-uint.md).

**Returned value**

-   The result of multiplication with given scale.

Type: [Decimal256](../../sql-reference/data-types/decimal.md).

Decomposes a time series using STL [(Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess)](https://www.wessa.net/download/stl.pdf) into a season, a trend and a residual component.

**Syntax**

``` sql
seriesDecomposeSTL(series, period);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values
- `period` - A positive number

The number of data points in `series` should be at least twice the value of `period`.

**Returned value**

- An array of four arrays where the first array include seasonal components, the second array - trend, the third array - residue component, and the fourth array - baseline(seasonal + trend) component.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

**Examples**

Query:

``` sql
SELECT seriesDecomposeSTL([10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34, 10.1, 20.45, 40.34], 3) AS print_0;

Detects outliers in series data using [Tukey Fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences).

**Syntax**

``` sql
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series);
seriesOutliersDetectTukey(series, min_percentile, max_percentile, k);
```

**Arguments**

- `series` - An array of numeric values.
- `min_quantile` - The minimum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range [(IQR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range). The value must be in range [0.02,0.98]. The default is 0.25.
- `max_quantile` - The maximum quantile to be used to calculate inter-quantile range (IQR). The value must be in range [0.02, 0.98]. The default is 0.75.
- `k` - Non-negative constant value to detect mild or stronger outliers. The default value is 1.5

At least four data points are required in `series` to detect outliers.

**Returned value**

- Returns an array of the same length as the input array where each value represents score of possible anomaly of corresponding element in the series. A non-zero score indicates a possible anomaly.

Type: [Array](../../sql-reference/data-types/array.md).

`operand`, `low`, `high` can be any native number type. `count` can only be unsigned native integer and its value cannot be zero.

**Syntax**

```sql
widthBucket(operand, low, high, count)
```

There is also a case insensitive alias called `WIDTH_BUCKET` to provide compatibility with other databases.

**Example**

Query:
[example:simple]

Result:

``` text

Calculates Morton encoding (ZCurve) for a list of unsigned integers

The function has two modes of operation:
- Simple
- Expanded

Simple: accepts up to 8 unsigned integers as arguments and produces a UInt64 code.
[example:simple]

Expanded: accepts a range mask (tuple) as a first argument and up to 8 unsigned integers as other arguments.
Each number in mask configures the amount of range expansion
1 - no expansion
2 - 2x expansion
3 - 3x expansion
....
Up to 8x expansion.
[example:range_expanded]
Note: tuple size must be equal to the number of the other arguments

Range expansion can be beneficial when you need a similar distribution for arguments with wildly different ranges (or cardinality)
For example: 'IP Address' (0...FFFFFFFF) and 'Country code' (0...FF)

Morton encoding for one argument is always the argument itself.
[example:identity]
Produces: `1`

You can expand one argument too:
[example:identity_expanded]
Produces: `32768`

The function also accepts columns as arguments:
[example:from_table]

But the range tuple must still be a constant:
[example:from_table_range]

Please note that you can fit only so much bits of information into Morton code as UInt64 has.
Two arguments will have a range of maximum 2^32 (64/2) each
Three arguments: range of max 2^21 (64/3) each
And so on, all overflow will be clamped to zero

Retrieves values from a dictionary.

Accepts 3 parameters:
-- name of the dictionary;
-- name of the column of the dictionary or tuple of column names;
-- key value - expression returning dictionary key-type value or tuple-type value - depending on the dictionary configuration;

Returned value: value of the dictionary attribute parsed in the DateTime if key is found, otherwise <null_value> element specified in the dictionary configuration.

Throws an exception if cannot parse the value of the attribute or the value does not match the attribute data type.
