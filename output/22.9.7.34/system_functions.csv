Calculates the arcsine of the argument.

Takes arbitrary numeric type, which includes floating point and integer numbers, as well as big integers and decimals and returns Float64.

For arguments in range [-1, 1] it returns the value in range of [-pi() / 2, pi() / 2].

It represents an inverse function to function 'sin' on this range:
[example:inverse]

It always returns Float64, even if the argument has Float32 type:
[example:float32]

For arguments outside of this range, it returns nan:
[example:nan]

Every self-respectful data scientist knows how to apply arcsine to improve ads click-through rate with ClickHouse.

Calculates the length of the string or array.

For String or FixedString argument: calculates the number of bytes in string.
[example:string1]

For Array argument: calculates the number of elements in the array.
[example:arr1]

If applied for FixedString argument, the function is a constant expression:
[example:constexpr]

Please note that the number of bytes in a string is not the same as the number of Unicode ""code points""
and it is not the same as the number of Unicode ""grapheme clusters"" (what we usually call ""characters"")
and it is not the same as the visible string width.
[example:unicode]

It is ok to have ASCII NUL bytes in strings, and they will be counted as well.
[example:nul]
